![](wellsfargo.png)

This repository talks about the mini projects which I have done for showing how we can fetch the data related to Wells Fargo using methods like REST API and Webscraping.

## Mini Project Folders

### Consumer Affairs

Here I have web scraped the Wells fargo consumer review comments. There are more than 2K consumer comments. This shows how we can fetch the data related to the bank from outside sources. This is a raw data extract and needs cleaning before we can gain any valuable insights.


### Tweeter Data

Here I have shown how we can also fetch the data from external source using Rest API access. Here I have tried to fetch the tweets data and also I have created few plots giving insight into the frequency of the tweets and also followers count of major US banks.


### US Consumer Financial Complaints

Here I have built a interactive Shiny application and hosted on the cloud. Check out the folder for details.
