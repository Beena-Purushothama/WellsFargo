Consumer Affairs - Wells Fargo Review Comments Extraction

In this mini project I am trying to show how we can extract the consumer review comments from external websites using webscraping.

* There are more than 2000 review comments from the users about Wells Fargo on this website
* Average rating for Wells Fargo is a little over 1 out of 5.
* I could see lot of latest review comments.

This is just the extract of the data from the website. As a next step before using this data for any further analysis, data cleanup is required.
