E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

mardecia of Dallas, TX	March 2, 2019	"Original review: March 2, 2019On 3/2/2019 I went to Wells Fargo to make a house payment. I was told that the Austen will not allow them to accept the payment. And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

Nithin of Henrico, VA	March 2, 2019	"Original review: March 2, 2019I got a credit card offer from Wells Fargo with invitation number and they rejected the card application when I applied for the card. I didn't reached out to them for the credit card. They just send such fraud offers I think.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1
Ben of Pittsburgh, PA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Applied for a Wells Fargo credit card. I was denied. My credit score listed on the rejection letter was 841. My income is 100k +. They say I have too many cards. All have zero balances because I pay balances every month. WTF! Idiots!	1
Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late. Please Wells Fargo try to improve situation like this, my whole family have account with Wells Fargo. It will be sad to let you go and find another bank. I had banking with you for over 8 years.	1
Lauren of Apopka, FL	Feb. 24, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 24, 2019I have been with ever since they bought Wachovia and for years I have said I was changing banks. Today was finally the day. After numerous inconveniences this week was the final straw. They cut my debit card off while I was vacationing in the mountains with my family due to fraudulent suspected activity. Their response to me was, ""We do this for your protection."" Had to borrow money from my family just to get back home."	1
Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

SAL of Fort Lauderdale, FL	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019Lauderhill, FL February 2nd, 2019. GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Steve of Santa Rosa, CA	Feb. 19, 2019	Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have to go to my branch or any other branch. It's the same!? There will be at least 6 teller windows and only 2 tellers working? And a line of customers that runs out the front doors? WHY? Wells Fargo always has enough people greet everyone at the door, and enough people to walk behind the two tellers that are trying to keep up with the long line of agitated customers and I notice BANKERS are off in the corners maybe helping customers? But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door?

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number.

I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Melvin of Fort Wayne, IN	Feb. 12, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 12, 2019Wells Fargo set my business up with First Data Card Service and endorsed them as the best. I was told I could sign up and cancel in 30 days if I did not want it. In 30 day no one came to set it up or help so I told them I wanted to cancel. Wells Fargo said, ""It is out of our hands. That it is up to First Data..."" I was told I can cancel but was required to make monthly payments for 3 years even if I never used the services... I will never trust Wells Fargo for my business needs."	1
Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three!

I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

A week later I was charged twice for rent from WF account and money from my savings taken without my knowledge. I was so upset I cried on the phone while this was being explained to me, an hour later the police had shown up at my door because I was so distraught over the matter.

Melvin of Fort Wayne, IN	Feb. 12, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 12, 2019Wells Fargo set my business up with First Data Card Service and endorsed them as the best. I was told I could sign up and cancel in 30 days if I did not want it. In 30 day no one came to set it up or help so I told them I wanted to cancel. Wells Fargo said, ""It is out of our hands. That it is up to First Data..."" I was told I can cancel but was required to make monthly payments for 3 years even if I never used the services... I will never trust Wells Fargo for my business needs."	1
Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376.

I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Steve of Santa Rosa, CA	Feb. 19, 2019	Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have to go to my branch or any other branch. It's the same!? There will be at least 6 teller windows and only 2 tellers working? And a line of customers that runs out the front doors? WHY? Wells Fargo always has enough people greet everyone at the door, and enough people to walk behind the two tellers that are trying to keep up with the long line of agitated customers and I notice BANKERS are off in the corners maybe helping customers? But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door? Can't those greeters, Bankers, and those people that walk back and forth behind the only two tellers that are really working help out, Man the empty windows, DON'T LET US SPEND 15 to 20 min standing in line always!	1

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376.

I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

And a line of customers that runs out the front doors? WHY? Wells Fargo always has enough people greet everyone at the door, and enough people to walk behind the two tellers that are trying to keep up with the long line of agitated customers and I notice BANKERS are off in the corners maybe helping customers? But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door? Can't those greeters, Bankers, and those people that walk back and forth behind the only two tellers that are really working help out, Man the empty windows, DON'T LET US SPEND 15 to 20 min standing in line always!	1

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday.

Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us.

Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door?

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Steve of Santa Rosa, CA	Feb. 19, 2019	Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have to go to my branch or any other branch. It's the same!? There will be at least 6 teller windows and only 2 tellers working? And a line of customers that runs out the front doors? WHY? Wells Fargo always has enough people greet everyone at the door, and enough people to walk behind the two tellers that are trying to keep up with the long line of agitated customers and I notice BANKERS are off in the corners maybe helping customers? But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door? Can't those greeters, Bankers, and those people that walk back and forth behind the only two tellers that are really working help out, Man the empty windows, DON'T LET US SPEND 15 to 20 min standing in line always!	1
Mel of Lakewood, NJ	Feb. 16, 2019	Original review: Feb. 16, 2019Wells Fargo did a hard pull on my credit score dated 02/01/19 without me knowing about it and I never applied for any car loan with them. I spoke with their customer service but still they did not do anything about it.	1
Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

A week later I was charged twice for rent from WF account and money from my savings taken without my knowledge. I was so upset I cried on the phone while this was being explained to me, an hour later the police had shown up at my door because I was so distraught over the matter. WF called them because I was upset. Who has the right to do that. I am leaving Wells Fargo."	1

Melvin of Fort Wayne, IN	Feb. 12, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 12, 2019Wells Fargo set my business up with First Data Card Service and endorsed them as the best. I was told I could sign up and cancel in 30 days if I did not want it. In 30 day no one came to set it up or help so I told them I wanted to cancel. Wells Fargo said, ""It is out of our hands. That it is up to First Data..."" I was told I can cancel but was required to make monthly payments for 3 years even if I never used the services... I will never trust Wells Fargo for my business needs."	1
Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone.

The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused.""

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job.

T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late. Please Wells Fargo try to improve situation like this, my whole family have account with Wells Fargo. It will be sad to let you go and find another bank. I had banking with you for over 8 years.	1

After numerous inconveniences this week was the final straw. They cut my debit card off while I was vacationing in the mountains with my family due to fraudulent suspected activity. Their response to me was, ""We do this for your protection."" Had to borrow money from my family just to get back home."	1
Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

SAL of Fort Lauderdale, FL	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019Lauderhill, FL February 2nd, 2019. GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door?

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late. Please Wells Fargo try to improve situation like this, my whole family have account with Wells Fargo. It will be sad to let you go and find another bank. I had banking with you for over 8 years.	1

Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

SAL of Fort Lauderdale, FL	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019Lauderhill, FL February 2nd, 2019. GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door?

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

mardecia of Dallas, TX	March 2, 2019	"Original review: March 2, 2019On 3/2/2019 I went to Wells Fargo to make a house payment. I was told that the Austen will not allow them to accept the payment. And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins.

I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three!

I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess.

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

James of Milwaukee, WI	Feb. 13, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 13, 2019My rent checks were late being paid thru ""bill pay"", wasn't their fault however I was misled by them to believe that the checks had cleared. A week later I was charged twice for rent from WF account and money from my savings taken without my knowledge. I was so upset I cried on the phone while this was being explained to me, an hour later the police had shown up at my door because I was so distraught over the matter. WF called them because I was upset. Who has the right to do that. I am leaving Wells Fargo."	1

Melvin of Fort Wayne, IN	Feb. 12, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 12, 2019Wells Fargo set my business up with First Data Card Service and endorsed them as the best. I was told I could sign up and cancel in 30 days if I did not want it. In 30 day no one came to set it up or help so I told them I wanted to cancel. Wells Fargo said, ""It is out of our hands. That it is up to First Data..."" I was told I can cancel but was required to make monthly payments for 3 years even if I never used the services... I will never trust Wells Fargo for my business needs."	1
Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

mardecia of Dallas, TX	March 2, 2019	"Original review: March 2, 2019On 3/2/2019 I went to Wells Fargo to make a house payment. I was told that the Austen will not allow them to accept the payment. And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon.

I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either.

I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Melvin of Fort Wayne, IN	Feb. 12, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 12, 2019Wells Fargo set my business up with First Data Card Service and endorsed them as the best. I was told I could sign up and cancel in 30 days if I did not want it. In 30 day no one came to set it up or help so I told them I wanted to cancel. Wells Fargo said, ""It is out of our hands. That it is up to First Data..."" I was told I can cancel but was required to make monthly payments for 3 years even if I never used the services... I will never trust Wells Fargo for my business needs."	1
Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376.

I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Steve of Santa Rosa, CA	Feb. 19, 2019	Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have to go to my branch or any other branch. It's the same!? There will be at least 6 teller windows and only 2 tellers working? And a line of customers that runs out the front doors? WHY? Wells Fargo always has enough people greet everyone at the door, and enough people to walk behind the two tellers that are trying to keep up with the long line of agitated customers and I notice BANKERS are off in the corners maybe helping customers? But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door? Can't those greeters, Bankers, and those people that walk back and forth behind the only two tellers that are really working help out, Man the empty windows, DON'T LET US SPEND 15 to 20 min standing in line always!	1

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376.

I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door?

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday.

""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door?

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

SAL of Fort Lauderdale, FL	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019Lauderhill, FL February 2nd, 2019. GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door?

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late. Please Wells Fargo try to improve situation like this, my whole family have account with Wells Fargo. It will be sad to let you go and find another bank. I had banking with you for over 8 years.	1

After numerous inconveniences this week was the final straw. They cut my debit card off while I was vacationing in the mountains with my family due to fraudulent suspected activity.

Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

SAL of Fort Lauderdale, FL	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019Lauderhill, FL February 2nd, 2019. GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD.

Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late. Please Wells Fargo try to improve situation like this, my whole family have account with Wells Fargo. It will be sad to let you go and find another bank. I had banking with you for over 8 years.	1

Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

SAL of Fort Lauderdale, FL	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019Lauderhill, FL February 2nd, 2019. GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late. Please Wells Fargo try to improve situation like this, my whole family have account with Wells Fargo. It will be sad to let you go and find another bank. I had banking with you for over 8 years.	1

Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

mardecia of Dallas, TX	March 2, 2019	"Original review: March 2, 2019On 3/2/2019 I went to Wells Fargo to make a house payment. I was told that the Austen will not allow them to accept the payment. And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

Fix things now, before it's too late. The competition is eating you breakfast, lunch and dinner!	1

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.

I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

I was so upset I cried on the phone while this was being explained to me, an hour later the police had shown up at my door because I was so distraught over the matter. WF called them because I was upset. Who has the right to do that. I am leaving Wells Fargo."	1

Melvin of Fort Wayne, IN	Feb. 12, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 12, 2019Wells Fargo set my business up with First Data Card Service and endorsed them as the best. I was told I could sign up and cancel in 30 days if I did not want it. In 30 day no one came to set it up or help so I told them I wanted to cancel. Wells Fargo said, ""It is out of our hands. That it is up to First Data..."" I was told I can cancel but was required to make monthly payments for 3 years even if I never used the services... I will never trust Wells Fargo for my business needs."	1
Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either.

I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Melvin of Fort Wayne, IN	Feb. 12, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 12, 2019Wells Fargo set my business up with First Data Card Service and endorsed them as the best. I was told I could sign up and cancel in 30 days if I did not want it. In 30 day no one came to set it up or help so I told them I wanted to cancel. Wells Fargo said, ""It is out of our hands. That it is up to First Data..."" I was told I can cancel but was required to make monthly payments for 3 years even if I never used the services... I will never trust Wells Fargo for my business needs."	1
Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us.

Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376.

I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Steve of Santa Rosa, CA	Feb. 19, 2019	Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have to go to my branch or any other branch. It's the same!? There will be at least 6 teller windows and only 2 tellers working? And a line of customers that runs out the front doors? WHY? Wells Fargo always has enough people greet everyone at the door, and enough people to walk behind the two tellers that are trying to keep up with the long line of agitated customers and I notice BANKERS are off in the corners maybe helping customers? But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door? Can't those greeters, Bankers, and those people that walk back and forth behind the only two tellers that are really working help out, Man the empty windows, DON'T LET US SPEND 15 to 20 min standing in line always!	1

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376.

I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

And a line of customers that runs out the front doors? WHY? Wells Fargo always has enough people greet everyone at the door, and enough people to walk behind the two tellers that are trying to keep up with the long line of agitated customers and I notice BANKERS are off in the corners maybe helping customers? But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door? Can't those greeters, Bankers, and those people that walk back and forth behind the only two tellers that are really working help out, Man the empty windows, DON'T LET US SPEND 15 to 20 min standing in line always!	1

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday.

Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us.

Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door?

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Steve of Santa Rosa, CA	Feb. 19, 2019	Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have to go to my branch or any other branch. It's the same!? There will be at least 6 teller windows and only 2 tellers working? And a line of customers that runs out the front doors? WHY? Wells Fargo always has enough people greet everyone at the door, and enough people to walk behind the two tellers that are trying to keep up with the long line of agitated customers and I notice BANKERS are off in the corners maybe helping customers? But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door? Can't those greeters, Bankers, and those people that walk back and forth behind the only two tellers that are really working help out, Man the empty windows, DON'T LET US SPEND 15 to 20 min standing in line always!	1
Mel of Lakewood, NJ	Feb. 16, 2019	Original review: Feb. 16, 2019Wells Fargo did a hard pull on my credit score dated 02/01/19 without me knowing about it and I never applied for any car loan with them. I spoke with their customer service but still they did not do anything about it.	1
Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

A week later I was charged twice for rent from WF account and money from my savings taken without my knowledge. I was so upset I cried on the phone while this was being explained to me, an hour later the police had shown up at my door because I was so distraught over the matter. WF called them because I was upset. Who has the right to do that. I am leaving Wells Fargo."	1

Melvin of Fort Wayne, IN	Feb. 12, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 12, 2019Wells Fargo set my business up with First Data Card Service and endorsed them as the best. I was told I could sign up and cancel in 30 days if I did not want it. In 30 day no one came to set it up or help so I told them I wanted to cancel. Wells Fargo said, ""It is out of our hands. That it is up to First Data..."" I was told I can cancel but was required to make monthly payments for 3 years even if I never used the services... I will never trust Wells Fargo for my business needs."	1
Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone.

The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused.""

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job.

T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late. Please Wells Fargo try to improve situation like this, my whole family have account with Wells Fargo. It will be sad to let you go and find another bank. I had banking with you for over 8 years.	1

After numerous inconveniences this week was the final straw. They cut my debit card off while I was vacationing in the mountains with my family due to fraudulent suspected activity. Their response to me was, ""We do this for your protection."" Had to borrow money from my family just to get back home."	1
Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

SAL of Fort Lauderdale, FL	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019Lauderhill, FL February 2nd, 2019. GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door?

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late. Please Wells Fargo try to improve situation like this, my whole family have account with Wells Fargo. It will be sad to let you go and find another bank. I had banking with you for over 8 years.	1

Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

SAL of Fort Lauderdale, FL	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019Lauderhill, FL February 2nd, 2019. GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door?

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

mardecia of Dallas, TX	March 2, 2019	"Original review: March 2, 2019On 3/2/2019 I went to Wells Fargo to make a house payment. I was told that the Austen will not allow them to accept the payment. And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins.

I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three!

I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess.

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

James of Milwaukee, WI	Feb. 13, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 13, 2019My rent checks were late being paid thru ""bill pay"", wasn't their fault however I was misled by them to believe that the checks had cleared. A week later I was charged twice for rent from WF account and money from my savings taken without my knowledge. I was so upset I cried on the phone while this was being explained to me, an hour later the police had shown up at my door because I was so distraught over the matter. WF called them because I was upset. Who has the right to do that. I am leaving Wells Fargo."	1

Melvin of Fort Wayne, IN	Feb. 12, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 12, 2019Wells Fargo set my business up with First Data Card Service and endorsed them as the best. I was told I could sign up and cancel in 30 days if I did not want it. In 30 day no one came to set it up or help so I told them I wanted to cancel. Wells Fargo said, ""It is out of our hands. That it is up to First Data..."" I was told I can cancel but was required to make monthly payments for 3 years even if I never used the services... I will never trust Wells Fargo for my business needs."	1
Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

mardecia of Dallas, TX	March 2, 2019	"Original review: March 2, 2019On 3/2/2019 I went to Wells Fargo to make a house payment. I was told that the Austen will not allow them to accept the payment. And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon.

I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either.

I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Melvin of Fort Wayne, IN	Feb. 12, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 12, 2019Wells Fargo set my business up with First Data Card Service and endorsed them as the best. I was told I could sign up and cancel in 30 days if I did not want it. In 30 day no one came to set it up or help so I told them I wanted to cancel. Wells Fargo said, ""It is out of our hands. That it is up to First Data..."" I was told I can cancel but was required to make monthly payments for 3 years even if I never used the services... I will never trust Wells Fargo for my business needs."	1
Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376.

I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Steve of Santa Rosa, CA	Feb. 19, 2019	Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have to go to my branch or any other branch. It's the same!? There will be at least 6 teller windows and only 2 tellers working? And a line of customers that runs out the front doors? WHY? Wells Fargo always has enough people greet everyone at the door, and enough people to walk behind the two tellers that are trying to keep up with the long line of agitated customers and I notice BANKERS are off in the corners maybe helping customers? But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door? Can't those greeters, Bankers, and those people that walk back and forth behind the only two tellers that are really working help out, Man the empty windows, DON'T LET US SPEND 15 to 20 min standing in line always!	1

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376.

I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door?

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday.

""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door?

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

SAL of Fort Lauderdale, FL	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019Lauderhill, FL February 2nd, 2019. GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door?

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late. Please Wells Fargo try to improve situation like this, my whole family have account with Wells Fargo. It will be sad to let you go and find another bank. I had banking with you for over 8 years.	1

After numerous inconveniences this week was the final straw. They cut my debit card off while I was vacationing in the mountains with my family due to fraudulent suspected activity.

Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

SAL of Fort Lauderdale, FL	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019Lauderhill, FL February 2nd, 2019. GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD.

Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late. Please Wells Fargo try to improve situation like this, my whole family have account with Wells Fargo. It will be sad to let you go and find another bank. I had banking with you for over 8 years.	1

Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

SAL of Fort Lauderdale, FL	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019Lauderhill, FL February 2nd, 2019. GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late. Please Wells Fargo try to improve situation like this, my whole family have account with Wells Fargo. It will be sad to let you go and find another bank. I had banking with you for over 8 years.	1

Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

mardecia of Dallas, TX	March 2, 2019	"Original review: March 2, 2019On 3/2/2019 I went to Wells Fargo to make a house payment. I was told that the Austen will not allow them to accept the payment. And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

Fix things now, before it's too late. The competition is eating you breakfast, lunch and dinner!	1

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.

I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

I was so upset I cried on the phone while this was being explained to me, an hour later the police had shown up at my door because I was so distraught over the matter. WF called them because I was upset. Who has the right to do that. I am leaving Wells Fargo."	1

Melvin of Fort Wayne, IN	Feb. 12, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 12, 2019Wells Fargo set my business up with First Data Card Service and endorsed them as the best. I was told I could sign up and cancel in 30 days if I did not want it. In 30 day no one came to set it up or help so I told them I wanted to cancel. Wells Fargo said, ""It is out of our hands. That it is up to First Data..."" I was told I can cancel but was required to make monthly payments for 3 years even if I never used the services... I will never trust Wells Fargo for my business needs."	1
Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either.

I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Melvin of Fort Wayne, IN	Feb. 12, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 12, 2019Wells Fargo set my business up with First Data Card Service and endorsed them as the best. I was told I could sign up and cancel in 30 days if I did not want it. In 30 day no one came to set it up or help so I told them I wanted to cancel. Wells Fargo said, ""It is out of our hands. That it is up to First Data..."" I was told I can cancel but was required to make monthly payments for 3 years even if I never used the services... I will never trust Wells Fargo for my business needs."	1
Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us.

Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376.

I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Steve of Santa Rosa, CA	Feb. 19, 2019	Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have to go to my branch or any other branch. It's the same!? There will be at least 6 teller windows and only 2 tellers working? And a line of customers that runs out the front doors? WHY? Wells Fargo always has enough people greet everyone at the door, and enough people to walk behind the two tellers that are trying to keep up with the long line of agitated customers and I notice BANKERS are off in the corners maybe helping customers? But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door? Can't those greeters, Bankers, and those people that walk back and forth behind the only two tellers that are really working help out, Man the empty windows, DON'T LET US SPEND 15 to 20 min standing in line always!	1

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376.

I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

And a line of customers that runs out the front doors? WHY? Wells Fargo always has enough people greet everyone at the door, and enough people to walk behind the two tellers that are trying to keep up with the long line of agitated customers and I notice BANKERS are off in the corners maybe helping customers? But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door? Can't those greeters, Bankers, and those people that walk back and forth behind the only two tellers that are really working help out, Man the empty windows, DON'T LET US SPEND 15 to 20 min standing in line always!	1

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday.

Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us.

Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door?

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Steve of Santa Rosa, CA	Feb. 19, 2019	Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have to go to my branch or any other branch. It's the same!? There will be at least 6 teller windows and only 2 tellers working? And a line of customers that runs out the front doors? WHY? Wells Fargo always has enough people greet everyone at the door, and enough people to walk behind the two tellers that are trying to keep up with the long line of agitated customers and I notice BANKERS are off in the corners maybe helping customers? But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door? Can't those greeters, Bankers, and those people that walk back and forth behind the only two tellers that are really working help out, Man the empty windows, DON'T LET US SPEND 15 to 20 min standing in line always!	1
Mel of Lakewood, NJ	Feb. 16, 2019	Original review: Feb. 16, 2019Wells Fargo did a hard pull on my credit score dated 02/01/19 without me knowing about it and I never applied for any car loan with them. I spoke with their customer service but still they did not do anything about it.	1
Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

A week later I was charged twice for rent from WF account and money from my savings taken without my knowledge. I was so upset I cried on the phone while this was being explained to me, an hour later the police had shown up at my door because I was so distraught over the matter. WF called them because I was upset. Who has the right to do that. I am leaving Wells Fargo."	1

Melvin of Fort Wayne, IN	Feb. 12, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 12, 2019Wells Fargo set my business up with First Data Card Service and endorsed them as the best. I was told I could sign up and cancel in 30 days if I did not want it. In 30 day no one came to set it up or help so I told them I wanted to cancel. Wells Fargo said, ""It is out of our hands. That it is up to First Data..."" I was told I can cancel but was required to make monthly payments for 3 years even if I never used the services... I will never trust Wells Fargo for my business needs."	1
Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone.

The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused.""

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job.

T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late. Please Wells Fargo try to improve situation like this, my whole family have account with Wells Fargo. It will be sad to let you go and find another bank. I had banking with you for over 8 years.	1

After numerous inconveniences this week was the final straw. They cut my debit card off while I was vacationing in the mountains with my family due to fraudulent suspected activity. Their response to me was, ""We do this for your protection."" Had to borrow money from my family just to get back home."	1
Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

SAL of Fort Lauderdale, FL	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019Lauderhill, FL February 2nd, 2019. GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door?

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late. Please Wells Fargo try to improve situation like this, my whole family have account with Wells Fargo. It will be sad to let you go and find another bank. I had banking with you for over 8 years.	1

Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

SAL of Fort Lauderdale, FL	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019Lauderhill, FL February 2nd, 2019. GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door?

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

mardecia of Dallas, TX	March 2, 2019	"Original review: March 2, 2019On 3/2/2019 I went to Wells Fargo to make a house payment. I was told that the Austen will not allow them to accept the payment. And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins.

I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three!

I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess.

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

James of Milwaukee, WI	Feb. 13, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 13, 2019My rent checks were late being paid thru ""bill pay"", wasn't their fault however I was misled by them to believe that the checks had cleared. A week later I was charged twice for rent from WF account and money from my savings taken without my knowledge. I was so upset I cried on the phone while this was being explained to me, an hour later the police had shown up at my door because I was so distraught over the matter. WF called them because I was upset. Who has the right to do that. I am leaving Wells Fargo."	1

Melvin of Fort Wayne, IN	Feb. 12, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 12, 2019Wells Fargo set my business up with First Data Card Service and endorsed them as the best. I was told I could sign up and cancel in 30 days if I did not want it. In 30 day no one came to set it up or help so I told them I wanted to cancel. Wells Fargo said, ""It is out of our hands. That it is up to First Data..."" I was told I can cancel but was required to make monthly payments for 3 years even if I never used the services... I will never trust Wells Fargo for my business needs."	1
Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

mardecia of Dallas, TX	March 2, 2019	"Original review: March 2, 2019On 3/2/2019 I went to Wells Fargo to make a house payment. I was told that the Austen will not allow them to accept the payment. And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon.

I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either.

I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Melvin of Fort Wayne, IN	Feb. 12, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 12, 2019Wells Fargo set my business up with First Data Card Service and endorsed them as the best. I was told I could sign up and cancel in 30 days if I did not want it. In 30 day no one came to set it up or help so I told them I wanted to cancel. Wells Fargo said, ""It is out of our hands. That it is up to First Data..."" I was told I can cancel but was required to make monthly payments for 3 years even if I never used the services... I will never trust Wells Fargo for my business needs."	1
Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376.

I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Steve of Santa Rosa, CA	Feb. 19, 2019	Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have to go to my branch or any other branch. It's the same!? There will be at least 6 teller windows and only 2 tellers working? And a line of customers that runs out the front doors? WHY? Wells Fargo always has enough people greet everyone at the door, and enough people to walk behind the two tellers that are trying to keep up with the long line of agitated customers and I notice BANKERS are off in the corners maybe helping customers? But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door? Can't those greeters, Bankers, and those people that walk back and forth behind the only two tellers that are really working help out, Man the empty windows, DON'T LET US SPEND 15 to 20 min standing in line always!	1

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376.

I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door?

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday.

""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door?

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

SAL of Fort Lauderdale, FL	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019Lauderhill, FL February 2nd, 2019. GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door?

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late. Please Wells Fargo try to improve situation like this, my whole family have account with Wells Fargo. It will be sad to let you go and find another bank. I had banking with you for over 8 years.	1

After numerous inconveniences this week was the final straw. They cut my debit card off while I was vacationing in the mountains with my family due to fraudulent suspected activity.

Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

SAL of Fort Lauderdale, FL	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019Lauderhill, FL February 2nd, 2019. GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD.

Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late. Please Wells Fargo try to improve situation like this, my whole family have account with Wells Fargo. It will be sad to let you go and find another bank. I had banking with you for over 8 years.	1

Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

SAL of Fort Lauderdale, FL	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019Lauderhill, FL February 2nd, 2019. GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late. Please Wells Fargo try to improve situation like this, my whole family have account with Wells Fargo. It will be sad to let you go and find another bank. I had banking with you for over 8 years.	1

Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

mardecia of Dallas, TX	March 2, 2019	"Original review: March 2, 2019On 3/2/2019 I went to Wells Fargo to make a house payment. I was told that the Austen will not allow them to accept the payment. And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

Fix things now, before it's too late. The competition is eating you breakfast, lunch and dinner!	1

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.

I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

I was so upset I cried on the phone while this was being explained to me, an hour later the police had shown up at my door because I was so distraught over the matter. WF called them because I was upset. Who has the right to do that. I am leaving Wells Fargo."	1

Melvin of Fort Wayne, IN	Feb. 12, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 12, 2019Wells Fargo set my business up with First Data Card Service and endorsed them as the best. I was told I could sign up and cancel in 30 days if I did not want it. In 30 day no one came to set it up or help so I told them I wanted to cancel. Wells Fargo said, ""It is out of our hands. That it is up to First Data..."" I was told I can cancel but was required to make monthly payments for 3 years even if I never used the services... I will never trust Wells Fargo for my business needs."	1
Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either.

I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Melvin of Fort Wayne, IN	Feb. 12, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 12, 2019Wells Fargo set my business up with First Data Card Service and endorsed them as the best. I was told I could sign up and cancel in 30 days if I did not want it. In 30 day no one came to set it up or help so I told them I wanted to cancel. Wells Fargo said, ""It is out of our hands. That it is up to First Data..."" I was told I can cancel but was required to make monthly payments for 3 years even if I never used the services... I will never trust Wells Fargo for my business needs."	1
Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us.

Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376.

I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Steve of Santa Rosa, CA	Feb. 19, 2019	Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have to go to my branch or any other branch. It's the same!? There will be at least 6 teller windows and only 2 tellers working? And a line of customers that runs out the front doors? WHY? Wells Fargo always has enough people greet everyone at the door, and enough people to walk behind the two tellers that are trying to keep up with the long line of agitated customers and I notice BANKERS are off in the corners maybe helping customers? But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door? Can't those greeters, Bankers, and those people that walk back and forth behind the only two tellers that are really working help out, Man the empty windows, DON'T LET US SPEND 15 to 20 min standing in line always!	1

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376.

I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

And a line of customers that runs out the front doors? WHY? Wells Fargo always has enough people greet everyone at the door, and enough people to walk behind the two tellers that are trying to keep up with the long line of agitated customers and I notice BANKERS are off in the corners maybe helping customers? But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door? Can't those greeters, Bankers, and those people that walk back and forth behind the only two tellers that are really working help out, Man the empty windows, DON'T LET US SPEND 15 to 20 min standing in line always!	1

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday.

Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us.

Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door?

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Steve of Santa Rosa, CA	Feb. 19, 2019	Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have to go to my branch or any other branch. It's the same!? There will be at least 6 teller windows and only 2 tellers working? And a line of customers that runs out the front doors? WHY? Wells Fargo always has enough people greet everyone at the door, and enough people to walk behind the two tellers that are trying to keep up with the long line of agitated customers and I notice BANKERS are off in the corners maybe helping customers? But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door? Can't those greeters, Bankers, and those people that walk back and forth behind the only two tellers that are really working help out, Man the empty windows, DON'T LET US SPEND 15 to 20 min standing in line always!	1
Mel of Lakewood, NJ	Feb. 16, 2019	Original review: Feb. 16, 2019Wells Fargo did a hard pull on my credit score dated 02/01/19 without me knowing about it and I never applied for any car loan with them. I spoke with their customer service but still they did not do anything about it.	1
Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

A week later I was charged twice for rent from WF account and money from my savings taken without my knowledge. I was so upset I cried on the phone while this was being explained to me, an hour later the police had shown up at my door because I was so distraught over the matter. WF called them because I was upset. Who has the right to do that. I am leaving Wells Fargo."	1

Melvin of Fort Wayne, IN	Feb. 12, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 12, 2019Wells Fargo set my business up with First Data Card Service and endorsed them as the best. I was told I could sign up and cancel in 30 days if I did not want it. In 30 day no one came to set it up or help so I told them I wanted to cancel. Wells Fargo said, ""It is out of our hands. That it is up to First Data..."" I was told I can cancel but was required to make monthly payments for 3 years even if I never used the services... I will never trust Wells Fargo for my business needs."	1
Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone.

The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused.""

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job.

T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late. Please Wells Fargo try to improve situation like this, my whole family have account with Wells Fargo. It will be sad to let you go and find another bank. I had banking with you for over 8 years.	1

After numerous inconveniences this week was the final straw. They cut my debit card off while I was vacationing in the mountains with my family due to fraudulent suspected activity. Their response to me was, ""We do this for your protection."" Had to borrow money from my family just to get back home."	1
Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

SAL of Fort Lauderdale, FL	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019Lauderhill, FL February 2nd, 2019. GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door?

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late. Please Wells Fargo try to improve situation like this, my whole family have account with Wells Fargo. It will be sad to let you go and find another bank. I had banking with you for over 8 years.	1

Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

SAL of Fort Lauderdale, FL	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019Lauderhill, FL February 2nd, 2019. GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door?

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

Anthony of Fort Collins, CO	Feb. 22, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 22, 2019I went into the Fort Collins branch at 3600 S. College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Ruben of Northridge, CA	Feb. 25, 2019	Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Worst bank ever, came here to open a business account, they said they close at 6 pm, I came at 5 pm, wait for an hour, nobody came up to me and asked anything. Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

Debbie of Avondale, AZ	Feb. 23, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 23, 2019Husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM, at no time did he see that the funds would be unavailable, (the branch was still closed) selected the button to confirm amount and next he discovered was the money was unavailable. He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

mardecia of Dallas, TX	March 2, 2019	"Original review: March 2, 2019On 3/2/2019 I went to Wells Fargo to make a house payment. I was told that the Austen will not allow them to accept the payment. And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Employee were talking to each other not work-related, people were waiting in line. They just didn't care at all. At 5:45 one of the banker came to me and finally asked me, I told him I want to open a business account, he said it won't be possible today, because it was late.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

GENTLEMEN: I/WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT WELLS FARGO BANK SINCE THEIR WEBSITE DOES NOT accept messaging. Our/my issue deals with ""Illegal money retention by the bank"". The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon. Bondi recovered from Wells Fargo a sizable 28/M. Please, kindly intervene with this institution accordingly. Thanking you, I/we remain.

His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins.

I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three!

I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess.

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

James of Milwaukee, WI	Feb. 13, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 13, 2019My rent checks were late being paid thru ""bill pay"", wasn't their fault however I was misled by them to believe that the checks had cleared. A week later I was charged twice for rent from WF account and money from my savings taken without my knowledge. I was so upset I cried on the phone while this was being explained to me, an hour later the police had shown up at my door because I was so distraught over the matter. WF called them because I was upset. Who has the right to do that. I am leaving Wells Fargo."	1

Melvin of Fort Wayne, IN	Feb. 12, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 12, 2019Wells Fargo set my business up with First Data Card Service and endorsed them as the best. I was told I could sign up and cancel in 30 days if I did not want it. In 30 day no one came to set it up or help so I told them I wanted to cancel. Wells Fargo said, ""It is out of our hands. That it is up to First Data..."" I was told I can cancel but was required to make monthly payments for 3 years even if I never used the services... I will never trust Wells Fargo for my business needs."	1
Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

mardecia of Dallas, TX	March 2, 2019	"Original review: March 2, 2019On 3/2/2019 I went to Wells Fargo to make a house payment. I was told that the Austen will not allow them to accept the payment. And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

E. D. of West Chester, PA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019I have been attempting to comply with Wells Fargo's procedures on an estate matter for over a month. Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark. This all speaks to a completely incompetent department. BADLY RUN, STEER CLEAR."	1
Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376. From Website we learn that Wells Fargo has a terrible record for abusive, illegal and unappropriated behavior. Recently - in December 2018 - Florida Attorney General Hon.

I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either.

I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Melvin of Fort Wayne, IN	Feb. 12, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 12, 2019Wells Fargo set my business up with First Data Card Service and endorsed them as the best. I was told I could sign up and cancel in 30 days if I did not want it. In 30 day no one came to set it up or help so I told them I wanted to cancel. Wells Fargo said, ""It is out of our hands. That it is up to First Data..."" I was told I can cancel but was required to make monthly payments for 3 years even if I never used the services... I will never trust Wells Fargo for my business needs."	1
Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

And to call customer service to make a payment. I contact Wells Fargo customer service and was told they could not accept a payment because the account was transferred to specialized loan servicing and to contact them. I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone. Was informed that my loan had not been released from the other company. I was informed by Wells Fargo that I should be receiving paperwork in the mail soon maybe within the next couple weeks. I am not pleased with the way the paperwork is being handled nor the communication associated with the account.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected. Should I ever get a new car and they say, ""Wells Fargo is your lender,"" I'm RUNNING out the door."	1

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

He came home and returned back to the bank to be told that due to in going into the ATM nothing they can do. He returned home and call the bank and they said the same thing. Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376.

I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Steve of Santa Rosa, CA	Feb. 19, 2019	Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have to go to my branch or any other branch. It's the same!? There will be at least 6 teller windows and only 2 tellers working? And a line of customers that runs out the front doors? WHY? Wells Fargo always has enough people greet everyone at the door, and enough people to walk behind the two tellers that are trying to keep up with the long line of agitated customers and I notice BANKERS are off in the corners maybe helping customers? But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door? Can't those greeters, Bankers, and those people that walk back and forth behind the only two tellers that are really working help out, Man the empty windows, DON'T LET US SPEND 15 to 20 min standing in line always!	1

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I informed them that I had not received any information from SLS and would like to make a payment and was informed that Wells Fargo would transfer the payment within 10 days. I was informed my customer service Wells Fargo that was incorrect. And they released the account on 2/28/2019. I contacted SLS and via telephone.

Each person I talk to has a different story, they lie about when they sent materials out, and no matter what is sent to them (per their own instructions) there is always another form. The latest is that I need two more forms and I should redo the forms they already have because if they don't all come in together, they ""will get confused."" They have wasted hours and hours of my time. On top of all that, when you DO finally get something from them in the mail, the letter is dated a full two weeks before the postmark.

Beth of Van Nuys, CA	March 1, 2019	"Original review: March 1, 2019On February 22, 2019 I closed an account at US. Bank (in Sherman Oaks, CA) and got a CASHIER'S CHECK. I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Zack of Costa Mesa, CA	Feb. 27, 2019	Original review: Feb. 27, 2019I am a college student and have been with Wells Fargo for 2 years and consistently having to watch over my shoulder to make sure my money doesn't disappear one day. Through the reordering, delayed charges (only to refund and charge again), and grouping of a week's worth of transactions all in the same day, (and then blaming it all on you when you confront them) I have paid over $2,100 in overdraft fees. Am I the best at finances? NO! But if you are a college student, or live paycheck to paycheck, balancing a checkbook against this system is a full time job. Now I am red flagged with other banks because of how many times I've gone negative with Wells Fargo. Lesson Learned. Rant Over.	1
T of Philadelphia, PA	Feb. 26, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 26, 2019This company is horrible. Things that need to be disclosed aren't. For example, when you incur a late fee, you have to call in to customer service and dictate to them how much you want to pay and how much should go to the late fee. Not to mention, you have to pay more. I've been paying my loan and if I am late, I include it in my payment. Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday. It gets better... I did say, ""I don't give a ** about the Federal Reserve, we need to fix a truck, can you at least release some of it."" ""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

The original contact with this bank was established in N.J. In the last four years I dealt with their Lauderhill-Inverrary Falls branch, close to my current place of abode. Thank you.As per records, our account ending with # ** was illegally and unduly blocked on Wells Fargo's books since January 2nd, 2013! Following unaccountable filed complaints and visits to their various N.J. and Florida branches. Only on April 13, 2018, book balance for $244/K was released to us. This after FIVE YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS OF ILLEGAL, ABUSIVE RETENTION OF OUR SAVINGS.It goes without saying that the illegally retained money - for five years and four months - has generated financial damages to us. We were also impeded to purchase at a bargain price the condo at ** where we have been living for years. Furthermore I/we have been unable to use our money for more profitable investments with a correctly estimated loss of us $28,376.

I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door?

Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.

E. of Brooklyn, NY	March 3, 2019	"Original review: March 3, 2019I discovered fraudulent activity on my account. Called Wells Fargo. Was transferred three times, on hold for long periods of time. Had to repeat my story four times. The fourth person I spoke with handled the dispute claim. The person did not speak clearly and was reading quickly. I had to interrupt several times to ask them to repeat themselves and slow down so I could understand what they were saying. It seemed they were wanting to end the call after indicating that the fraudulent charges would be reversed. I had to ask that they cancel my debit card. This is something they should offer to me. I shouldn't have to tell them how to do their job. I don't know if the person was new and didn't know what they were doing, or what. But my confidence in Wells Fargo is now severely shaken.

I took that CASHIER'S CHECK to my account at Wells Fargo Bank on February 22, 2019 not more than 30 minutes later. For those of you who don't realize what a Cashier's check is, a cashier's check is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds, signed by a cashier. Cashier's checks ARE TREATED AS GUARANTEED FUNDS BECAUSE THE BANK, NOT THE PURCHASER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE AMOUNT.Apparently no one at Wells Fargo Bank knows this -- or this is yet another ""bad policy."" Today is March 1, 2019 -- 6 days later -- and Wells Fargo is still showing a HOLD. We all know that banks now use ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS -- so why is it that they treat CASHIER'S CHECKS the same way they would treat a personal check? I'm irate.

Now that I'm at the end of my loan, I have all these late fees that have added up over the years. Then when you ask to speak to a manager, you are put on hold and then somehow disconnected.

Craig of Rapid City, SD	Feb. 25, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 25, 2019Traveled to Denver, Colorado with my family for a family holiday weekend. I carried a Wells Fargo credit card with a $20,000.00 credit limit and pay my balance off each month. Was at a restaurant in Denver and my Wells card was declined...no problem I had a Discover Card who facilitated the transaction. Went to a store and tried to purchase goods... Wells declined my card...no problem, I had a Capital One card. I called Wells Fargo credit card department to ascertain what the issue was and they advised me they rejected transactions since I was outside my normal usage area. I gave the information that I would be staying in Denver for a specific time period and was advised I could use my card. Dinner that night with friends, used the Wells Fargo credit card and was declined. No problem...I had a Capital One card.I called Wells Fargo and asked why the card was declined. I was told I was using the card outside my normal usage... I live in Rapid City, SD. I asked them why the other credit card companies were not rejecting my credit transactions. No answer... They then started asking questions to verify who they were talking to and progressively got worse. That was after informing them that I had over a 2 million dollar in personal relationship with them and had been a customer for over 25 years. I asked them to close my account which they did. They then froze my PMA accounts so I could not make a transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account for security purposes...So again I am on the phone with trying to ascertain why they would not allow me to make a transfer between my Wells accounts. They release the freeze.I then wrote a letter to the Wells Fargo board of directors advising them of my how long the account been opened, my deposit and PMA over $1.750M relationship and that I owned over $150,000 in Wells Fargo stock. Advised them that the way they handled this event did not bid well with their customer. They did respond in typical Wells Fargo narrative. They reviewed the series of events and told me that they had unfrozen my PMA once I called in and that my credit card was frozen to protect me from fraudulent charges. Thank goodness Capital One nor Discover card was not as protective. I have since opened a credit card account with Chase and moved business from Wells Fargo Investments to Vanguard. I would stay away from Wells Fargo.

Also they said our account was overdrawn due to our car insurance coming through, which they charged a overdraft for, and still we have to wait till the Federal Reserve was open on Monday.

""No we can't,"" told us to go write a check, for the parts he needs to fix his truck, we said, ""We have automatic withdraws coming through and what about overdraft fee?"" Of course they are no responsible for that, so they get our money till Monday. We go all weekend with nothing, and they get all the fees for overdraft because my husband deposited his paycheck in the ATM as he always does and there has never been a hold on OUR MONEY.I filed a complaint with the bank and also asked the guy to stop talking to me in a condescending tone. Informed him, ""When you finally give us our money if anything is left after all the overdraft are paid we will be closing our account,"" and asked him how he would feel if you needed to fix a truck get gas and food, and have bills coming through, of course I did not get much on an answer.

College, the branch manager, **, didn't know about the 600 dollar new customer offer. Even after I showed him the offer on my iPhone, he refused to set me up with an account. His district manager, **, who I had to call myself, addressed the issue with that branch, which she manages after four days had passed. **, basically, made up excuses for **, and referred me to a Kahlee (banker) at another branch in Fort Collins. Kahlee tried to discourage me from taking the offer by saying: She didn't think I could keep the minimum balance of 25,000, to keep the offer valid. I have tried to contact Wells Fargo customer service, but I get the runaround.Today, I spoke to a Sienna, who said she couldn't find the offer either. I offered her to Google it but she didn't know how, she said. By the way, I had to call Sienna, even though I was guaranteed someone would call me within one business day. It took three! I reported this to the Federal Reserve Board Consumer Protection. I hope I see some action done against this horrible institution!

Margie of Milledgeville, GA	Feb. 21, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 21, 2019I had a Wells Fargo credit card but it was closed by Wells Fargo after filing a consumer complaint and continued calls. Thus, I received money in a class action lawsuit regarding this company with similar complaints. Two in fact. Today I am near completion paying off my card. I am unable to access my account online, do not receive paper bills, therefore do not have my credit account number. I have no way of obtaining this.
                    
                        
                    
                        
                            I called Wells Fargo to access online. I received a temporary password and did succeed in accessing my account, and changed my password. I returned to my account today and once again, my account is suspended for unknown reasons. Once again I have to call but cannot get through because I do not have an account number. I can't even write Wells Fargo because EVERYTHING I do requires an account number. My account has been closed for over 3 years.Wells Fargo doesn't think ahead, nor plan for such circumstances.I will never ever choose this bank due to their class actions suits, their history of problems and reputation. They need to be closed and clearly unable to support the services needed for their clients. I will need to travel 45 minutes away to pay my account and just hope that I will be able to pay without an account number. This bank frustrates me to the max.

Suejaan of Boynton Beach, FL	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019I was scammed and made a police report and immediately informed this bank. I was working part time for an industry and was paid in fake checks. Not only did all those checks come back, but the scammers got my actually money also. I called Wells Fargo multiple times to close this account because of the fraud, and to make sure nothing could be pulled or deposited into that account. Each time, I was ASSURED that nothing would post to the account, and if so, it would be returned. Unfortunately before I was scammed, I had already filed my tax return, and it was in the process of being deposited into that same account. I was unable to change the bank information, as the IRS had already accepted the return. Again, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and I was told that the money would be returned back to the IRS. That was not true. The money was posted to the account that had the fraud activity! I had no access to my tax refund! I called Wells Fargo again and was told, by a SUPERVISOR, that I had to contact the their ACH department to see if they can send the deposit back to the IRS. Apparently, that department was closed at the time, so I had to call back. I called back again, explained the story again, and was told by another SUPERVISOR that the ACH department doesn't return deposits anymore. As you can imagine, at this point I am fed up. I reached out to the IRS and had to fill out a form, and overnight it to them, for them to ask Wells Fargo to send the deposit back to them, and they would issue me a check. Wells Fargo has still NOT released the money.

Steph of Tabernash, CO	Feb. 20, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 20, 2019Wells Fargo needs to get a clue about what is modern customer service. Instead of just giving me the scripted responses during my transactions how about you actually listen to what I am saying and responding appropriately. Also gauge your customer. When someone is in a hurry, no they don't want their balance, no they don't want to hear about a new service and yes they know their cash deposit is available immediately (duh it's cash). Today I had to endure another new cashier spiel after waiting for 15 minutes to make a simple cash deposit at drive through. I am a 30 year customer with Wells Fargo because I have few national options where I live. I called her to get my deposit back because I needed to get to work. She proceeded to tell me that they were very busy in the lobby and had to take customers in order. This week for the first time ever I was told I had to give them an ID with a cash deposit... WTF?! The new teller proceeded to condescendingly tell me how it was for my security. Then when she condescendingly told me, ""The good news is your deposit is immediately available,"" I almost lost it. Who trains these people? I am now researching online banking options. I've had it with Wells Fargo. They smile at your face, take your money and offer no service. They get worse and worse every year.

James of Charlotte, NC	Feb. 19, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have been banking with Wells Fargo for years, and have stood with them through all the terrible problems they have been trying to recover from. Recently, they had a worldwide outage that affected millions with everything from account information to actually using their credit/debit cards. It took days for things to start getting better, and even now, two weeks later, there are still problems that they are denying and trying to put the blame elsewhere. When logged in both online and through their app, only the last few months of history is available, everything else just gives an error message that ""account information is temporarily unavailable"". This has been going on for two weeks. I spend an hour on the phone with several people, and they are pretty much useless. They give excuses, say things that are false, runaround the issue, etc. At the end of the day, they simply are clueless and helpless as their broken machine runs itself into the ground, and it's truly sad.

Steve of Santa Rosa, CA	Feb. 19, 2019	Original review: Feb. 19, 2019I have to go to my branch or any other branch. It's the same!? There will be at least 6 teller windows and only 2 tellers working? And a line of customers that runs out the front doors? WHY? Wells Fargo always has enough people greet everyone at the door, and enough people to walk behind the two tellers that are trying to keep up with the long line of agitated customers and I notice BANKERS are off in the corners maybe helping customers? But usually not! WHY? When the line of loyal (up to now) customers is out the door? Can't those greeters, Bankers, and those people that walk back and forth behind the only two tellers that are really working help out, Man the empty windows, DON'T LET US SPEND 15 to 20 min standing in line always!	1
Mel of Lakewood, NJ	Feb. 16, 2019	Original review: Feb. 16, 2019Wells Fargo did a hard pull on my credit score dated 02/01/19 without me knowing about it and I never applied for any car loan with them. I spoke with their customer service but still they did not do anything about it.	1
Janice of Louisville, KY	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019This company is absolutely ridiculous. I called in September 2018 and informed them I would be retiring at the end of the year and asked for the process to get my money in installments. I was told I had to wait until I actually retired. I called back in January 2019 and was told I need to fill out a name change from along with supporting documentation before they could start my 401K request. I was told I had to fill out forms to get the process started. I filled out the forms. Had them notarized and mailed them in. After a couple of weeks I called them and again told them I want my 401K. Again I filled out forms, had them notarized and mailed them in. Today 2-14-19, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying I filled out the wrong forms and will need new forms and have them notarized again before they can process my request. I let him know I am not pleased with their company and how ridiculous it is trying to get ""my"" money!!"	1
Brooke of Spring, TX	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019Terrible staff that doesn't listen to the customers' issue and try to help. My friend/ex-husband/father of my children died and I've been paying his Wells mortgage for OUR kids with MY money from MY Wells account - I'm a Wells customer and so was he, I wanted to set up auto pay for me to pay his mortgage with my own money AND deposit $1 or anything of my money into his checking account just to prevent it from closing due to no activity because I do not have time nor want to allocate 5k of my money to hire an attorney BUT I am PAYING all of his bills. It's hard to pay 5k for an attorney to take control of a checking account with under $100, my children's father was on disability and his mother that lived with him stole the little money he had after he died. Wells wouldn't let me deposit $1 into his account AND tonight I learned I can't pay his mortgage via phone like I have been doing ALL because they INSISTED by showing them the death certificate I could deposit MY $1 into his account - but they lied to get what they wanted, after I showed them the death certificate they insisted on the court papers that WE DON'T have. I didn't have to show them ANYTHING (tricky liars) and then I could have deposited the $1 and continued to pay the mortgage. I rented the house, it covers the mortgage and preserves the house for the children, so there is NO GOOD reason to pay 5k to an attorney EXCEPT Wells will not let me pay the mortgage so they can attempt to STEAL the house I guess. I have been with Wells for over 20 years AND I will cancel them if I can't easily pay his mortgage with my own money!

WF of San Francisco, CA	Feb. 14, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 14, 2019I started using Wells Fargo after moving to California as they seemed to have more branches and ATMs in the area where I live. I have multiple premium accounts with them including a mortgage account. My overall impression of this bank is that local branch people were nice and friendly when I first opened accounts and deposit money; as soon as those accounts are open, same people became cold and indifferent.Deposit accounts are separate from credit cards and mortgage accounts. Even if you had a large deposit account with them, you could be treated very poorly by their credit card or mortgage department because they don't see you as an overall valued customer of Wells Fargo. Their executive office/customer care department sometimes defers to decisions made by those separate departments and do not really provide substantive care or satisfying solutions to customers, which is very different experience with other major banks that I used before. Without getting into much details, I am closing my accounts and moving money away and do not recommend this bank to anyone who wants to be treated with respect and dignity.

James of Milwaukee, WI	Feb. 13, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 13, 2019My rent checks were late being paid thru ""bill pay"", wasn't their fault however I was misled by them to believe that the checks had cleared. A week later I was charged twice for rent from WF account and money from my savings taken without my knowledge. I was so upset I cried on the phone while this was being explained to me, an hour later the police had shown up at my door because I was so distraught over the matter. WF called them because I was upset. Who has the right to do that. I am leaving Wells Fargo."	1
Erica of Port Saint Lucie, FL	Feb. 12, 2019	Original review: Feb. 12, 2019We've been with Wells Fargo for over 20 years. They've always had questionable banking practices and horrible customer service. Since the recent nationwide outage, my account haywire due to their error.	1
Melvin of Fort Wayne, IN	Feb. 12, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 12, 2019Wells Fargo set my business up with First Data Card Service and endorsed them as the best. I was told I could sign up and cancel in 30 days if I did not want it. In 30 day no one came to set it up or help so I told them I wanted to cancel. Wells Fargo said, ""It is out of our hands. That it is up to First Data..."" I was told I can cancel but was required to make monthly payments for 3 years even if I never used the services... I will never trust Wells Fargo for my business needs."	1
Monika of Redwood City, CA	Feb. 10, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 10, 2019On 2/7/2019, I drove some 40 miles to San Francisco, specifically to empty and close my safe deposit box at the Wells Fargo Union Trust office on 2 Grant St only to be told that their “computer system was down nationwide”, thus I could not close the box. To make a long story short, after I emptied the box, I wanted to return the two keys to close the box and end its lease because I will never use it again.Hard to believe, but a bank manager and two other employees absolutely refused to accept the two keys for the empty box. Instead, I was told I had to come back another day when their computer system was up to return the keys and close the box or I will be charged another fee of $45.00 for the lease of the box and they will keep my $25 key deposit.In other words, Wells Fargo is insisting that I have to waste another 3 hours of my time and drive again to downtown San Francisco just because they can’t keep their computer system functioning. To make matters worse, my efforts to return the keys at another Wells Fargo branch near me, when the system was up, were equally unsuccessful.

David of Elkhart, IN	Feb. 10, 2019	Original review: Feb. 10, 2019More times than not, I am unable to access my account for my auto loan or credit card account. Who works on their IT the three stooges? Wells Fargo will be no more within a few years with all their constant ineptitude and poor service and quality standards. Fix things now, before it's too late. The competition is eating you breakfast, lunch and dinner!	1

David of Tipp City, OH	Feb. 8, 2019	"Original review: Feb. 8, 2019Wells Fargo would not release my mother's 401K for her funeral expenses after she deceased. They told me they had to confirm with Red Lobster that I was a beneficiary at which they did and I was told they did. They told me they would send me a form once they confirm that which I had to fill out in my mother's death certificate in. I also had to send in my social security card image, my phone number, address. I was told they would not have sent me this letter if they did had not confirmed but they will not release the money now saying they didn't confirm it. Kept being told it would take two weeks after confirming my mother died two months ago. The funeral home still needs paid and they won't release the money. Don't believe it's legal for them to take my social security number and make me give it to them, send them death certificate and all my information if I was not a beneficiary. Red Robster confirm that I was a beneficiary to me over the phone and said they would send the information to them and that they already had sent the information to them once. Wells Fargo still will not speak to me or give me the money so I can pay the funeral expenses. I even offered for them to make the check out directly to the funeral home. I feel as though they're trying to steal my mother's money and make interest on it or commissions as long as they can. It is to my knowledge that Wells Fargo has been involved in laundering money for drug cartels. They were fraudulently starting credit cards under customers' accounts. And now they are not releasing funds to pay for a woman's funeral that put that money in there and deserves that money. Do not Bank get loans or trust Wells Fargo with any of your money. They apparently are crooks. When you can launder money for drug cartels and still be open for business and nobody went to prison for it. Steal deceased people's retirement funds for your benefit. This company needs shut down. I will continue to make complaints on every Federal website, Congressional website, treasury website and reaching out to news agencies until this company takes care of their responsibilities. I urge that everybody else that is having issues with Wells Fargo dealings in fraudulent manners please do the same. Nothing will be fixed until they are held accountable. Somebody needs to go to jail.
